# Machine Learning Projects: Supervised & Unsupervised Learning

## Overview  
This repository contains four machine learning projects covering both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Projects  

### 1. Gender Classification from Names  
Developed a supervised learning model using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and other classifiers to predict gender based on name-based features such as suffixes, length, and vowel patterns.

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction  
Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks to predict passenger survival with optimized performance. Applied hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation techniques.

### 3. Bank Marketing Customer Segmentation  
Performed clustering analysis using K-Means and PCA on banking data to segment customers for more effective marketing strategies. Analyzed key features to enhance customer targeting and campaign success rates.

### 4. Heart Disease Analysis  
Explored heart disease prediction using Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers. Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and clustering analysis to identify key risk factors. Evaluated model performance and feature importance to improve diagnostic accuracy.
